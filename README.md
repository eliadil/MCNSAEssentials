MCNSAEssentials
===============
Provides various "essential" commands and components for running and moderating the mcnsa.com servers.

See the [Code Guide](https://github.com/MCNSA/MCNSAEssentials/wiki/Code-Guide) For help understanding how the plugin is laid out, and how it is expected to operate. This is mostly for developers looking to maintain and extend the plugin.

For end-users (server-administrators), you will probably want to check out the [Command Information](https://github.com/MCNSA/MCNSAEssentials/wiki/Command-Information) page. This page lists all available components, their subsequent commands and aliases, how to use each command, the permission nodes required to run each command, as well as a short description of what everything does.
